Key Features:

Toggle Button: The main feature of this clone is the toggle button, which enables users to switch between a black screen and a white screen with a single click. The button serves as a visual switch, providing an interactive element for users to control the appearance of the screen.

Black and White Screen: When the toggle button is pressed, the screen transitions to a black background color, creating a dark theme. Pressing the button again reverts the screen to a white background color, giving a lighter and more conventional appearance.

Usage:
To experience the Facebook clone, users can simply open the HTML file in a web browser. They will see the familiar Facebook user interface replicated, with the toggle button prominently displayed. Clicking the toggle button will instantly change the screen color, providing an intuitive way to switch between the black and white modes.

Additional Notes:

Responsiveness: The Facebook clone is designed to be responsive, ensuring that it displays appropriately on different devices and screen sizes. It adapts to varying viewport dimensions to maintain an optimal user experience.

Compatibility: The Facebook clone has been tested and confirmed to work on modern web browsers, ensuring compatibility for a wide range of users.
